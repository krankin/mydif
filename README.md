A simple test of ruby skill

Objective
=====

These two files contain strings. Write a ruby script to take the contents of file1 and compares them to file2. Print the lines that appear in file1 but do not appear in file2. 


Hints and potentially unnecessary information
=====

- the line number on which a given string appears is irrelevant
- comparison should be case sensitive
- it is merely a coincidence that each file contains 1000 lines, do not assume it will always be that way
- Bonus points if your code is written in a reusable fashion. 
- Bonus points if your code is testable.
